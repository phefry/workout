# 📖☕ Book & Coffee Haven

**Book & Coffee Haven** is a cozy, responsive website created by **Phefry** using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s designed for coffee lovers and book enthusiasts who want to enjoy a peaceful and inspiring space.

## 🌟 Project Description

This website represents a book café where users can:

- Explore the menu (coffee, pastries, library)
- Learn about services and pricing plans
- Read customer reviews

Everything is built from scratch using frontend technologies—no frameworks or libraries other than Boxicons and Typed.js.

## 🎨 Color Scheme & Inspiration

The color theme is inspired by **coffee tones** and **book pages**, using warm, earthy shades to evoke a comfortable and relaxing environment.

| Element           | Color Used  | Description                          |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| Primary Text / Buttons | `#4E342E` | Deep brown - like brewed coffee     |
| Background Shades | `#D7CCC8`   | Light coffee cream tone              |
| Accent Elements   | `#A1887F`   | Warm neutral for highlights          |
| Footer & Navbar   | `#3E2723`   | Dark brown, calming base tone        |

These colors were chosen to simulate the experience of being in a rustic café with wooden furniture and shelves filled with books.
